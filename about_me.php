            <p>I am Sami Khalifa, a software developer from the Netherlands. I specialize mostly in back-end and front-end development. Currently, I am studying software development at VISTA College. Additionally, I pursued photography for six months.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I work well both in team settings and independently. When it comes to work, I am naturally curious and strive to understand how everything functions. I also push myself out of my comfort zone by studying areas where I am less proficient.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Outside of work, I enjoy drawing, reading books, gaming, and boxing. Furthermore, I have been practicing the piano since 2022.</p>
